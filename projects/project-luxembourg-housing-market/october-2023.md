The chart presents a clear negative correlation between the average square meter price of property and its distance from the city center in Luxembourg for October 2023. Properties closest to the city center, particularly in Luxembourg itself, command the highest prices, while those in more distant areas like Clervaux show a significant decrease in price. This suggests that proximity to the city center drives real estate values, and as distance increases, average prices decline correspondingly.
