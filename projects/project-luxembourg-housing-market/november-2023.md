The chart illustrates a negative correlation between the average price per square meter for properties and their distance from the city center (Gare Centrale) in November 2023. Luxembourg city has the highest property prices and is closest to the center, with prices declining as the distance increases. Locations like Diekirch, Vianden, and Wiltz offer much lower prices but are situated considerably farther from Gare Centrale. The data suggests that proximity to the city center significantly influences property values across various regions.
